# CS_NEA
My project for my A level NEA. This was made during highschool and is very buggy and unstable because I was still inexperienced in programming and wrote this over a short period of time. Ps. This version is broken due to very bad coding decisions by high-school me, so future me should go back and fix it or copy over my old version.
